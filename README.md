# Delong

Delong is a trustless, privacy-preserving computation platform tailored for longevity and biomedical research. It combines blockchain-based governance with secure TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) computation to enable researchers to analyze sensitive bio-data without compromising privacy. By leveraging decentralized governance and hardware-enforced confidentiality, Delong allows scientists to perform complex analyses on encrypted datasets contributed by users, all while ensuring data providers retain full privacy and control. This platform is currently deployed on the Phala Network, integrating its large-scale TEE infrastructure with on-chain DAO governance for algorithm approval.

## Introduction

Longevity and biomedical research are entering a data-driven era, yet they face persistent challenges in funding and data sharing. Traditional funding mechanisms for scientific research are slow and centralized, often involving lengthy grant processes that delay critical projects. Moreover, access to high-quality bio-data is limited by privacy concerns and regulatory barriers – hospitals, biobanks, and individuals are understandably cautious about sharing raw genomic or health data. These issues stifle the pace of discovery in aging and medical research, as scientists struggle to obtain both the resources and the data needed for breakthroughs.

Delong was conceived to address these challenges by harnessing Web3 technologies and trusted hardware. In the spirit of Decentralized Science (DeSci), Delong provides a decentralized platform where research funding can be streamlined and sensitive data can be utilized securely. By using blockchain and tokenization, the platform can support new funding models (such as community-driven grants or tokenized project stakes) that accelerate resource acquisition. Simultaneously, the integration of TEE-based computation ensures that even highly sensitive biological datasets (genomic sequences, health records, trial data, etc.) can be contributed and analyzed without exposing private information. The introduction of Delong marks a significant step toward a fast, transparent, and secure ecosystem for longevity research, empowering both data contributors and scientists in a mutually beneficial model.

## Motivation

### Funding Bottlenecks
Scientific progress in longevity research is often hampered by slow funding cycles. Researchers can wait months or years for grants, delaying experiments and innovation. Delong tackles this by incorporating blockchain-based funding mechanisms. For example, scientists can raise research funds via token issuance or decentralized grants on the platform, engaging a global community of supporters. This democratization of funding not only speeds up capital flow but also aligns incentives – supporters can have a stake in successful outcomes, and projects are not solely at the mercy of traditional institutions. The result is an agile funding environment where promising longevity studies get timely resources.

### Data Privacy and Accessibility
Equally critical is the scarcity of accessible data due to privacy concerns. Breakthroughs in biomedical AI and analytics require large, diverse datasets (genomic, clinical, longitudinal health records), but individuals and institutions are reluctant to share raw data for fear of misuse or regulatory violation. Delong’s design directly addresses this by creating a privacy-preserving data contribution model. Users (patients, biobank participants, etc.) can contribute their bio-data, which is encrypted client-side with the TEE’s public key before submission. Because the data is encrypted at the source, no intermediaries – not even the platform operators or infrastructure providers – ever see the plaintext. This gives contributors confidence that their sensitive information (e.g. DNA sequences or medical history) will remain confidential. In turn, researchers gain access to a vastly expanded pool of data that was previously siloed or inaccessible, now available for analysis under strict privacy guarantees. By overcoming the data hoarding dilemma, Delong stands to accelerate insights in aging and health, as algorithms can finally tap into rich datasets that were off-limits before.

## System Architecture

Delong employs a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that ensures trustless execution and end-to-end data protection. The system is composed of smart contracts on the blockchain for governance and logging, and secure off-chain TEE nodes for performing computations. At a high level, the workflow involves the following steps:

1. **Data Contribution**: Users encrypt their sensitive biological data on the client side using the public key of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) node. The encrypted data package is then submitted to the Delong platform. The data is either stored directly inside the TEE’s secure storage or persisted encrypted in a distributed storage (e.g. IPFS) such that only the TEE can decrypt it. This step ensures that raw data never leaves the user’s possession in unencrypted form – platform maintainers or observers cannot glean any usable information even at the moment of upload. Each data contribution is also logged on-chain (as an event or record) to provide an immutable trail of what data was contributed (by reference, not content) and when, establishing provenance without revealing the data itself.

2. **Algorithm Submission & Governance**: Scientists who wish to run analyses on the data contribute their algorithm code to the blockchain for review. Instead of sending code directly to a server, the scientist registers the algorithm (or a reference to it, such as a cryptographic hash or IPFS link to the code) on Delong’s blockchain by invoking a smart contract (e.g., an AlgorithmReview contract). The submitted algorithm goes through a DAO governance process – a decentralized community or committee reviews the code to ensure it adheres to privacy standards (e.g. it does not attempt to output raw data or otherwise leak information). This can involve a formal audit or community voting. Only algorithms that pass this governance/audit phase are approved and marked on-chain as eligible for execution. The blockchain thus acts as the gatekeeper, ensuring that only vetted code will be allowed to run on user data. This mechanism eliminates the need to trust any single party to decide what code is safe – the decision is transparent and collectively governed.

3. **TEE Execution**: Once an algorithm is approved on-chain, the off-chain TEE workers pick up the task. A Delong compute node (operated in a TEE on the Phala Network) monitors the blockchain for approved algorithm tasks. When it finds an approved algorithm and matching available dataset, it retrieves the encrypted data (which it can decrypt internally using its private key) and the algorithm code (e.g., from a content-addressed storage like IPFS or from the transaction payload). Before execution, the TEE can perform a remote attestation to prove to the platform (and data owners) that it is running the genuine Delong enclave software and not a tampered version. Then, within the isolated enclave, the algorithm code is executed on the decrypted user data. The TEE’s hardware isolation guarantees that even the server operator or any malware on the host cannot peek into the computation. The computation occurs as if on a completely sealed computer, which produces results that can only be accessed by authorized parties.

4. **Result Encryption & Delivery**: After the algorithm finishes processing the data, the results (e.g. aggregate statistics, trained model parameters, or analytic insights) are encrypted with the scientist’s public key (or a key specified for that job). This means only the intended recipient (the scientist or research team who submitted the algorithm) can decrypt and view the results. The encrypted results are then delivered back through the platform – for instance, the TEE might send a transaction or off-chain message with a reference to the encrypted output. The scientist can retrieve the output and decrypt it with their private key, obtaining the insights without the platform ever seeing the plaintext result. All usage of data is transparently logged via on-chain events (e.g., a DataUsage log entry linking the algorithm and data set, without revealing specifics) which serves both accounting (for incentives) and audit purposes. If the platform has a reward system for data contributors, these logs would later be used to distribute rewards (for example, micropayments or tokens to data owners each time their data is used in a computation).

This architecture ensures a complete separation of concerns: the blockchain layer handles governance, access control, and audit trails in a tamper-proof manner, while the TEE layer handles the heavy computation on sensitive data in a secure enclave. Thanks to this design, Delong achieves a level of trustlessness and privacy that is impossible with traditional centralized research platforms. Researchers do not need to trust Delong’s operators or servers, only the code (which is open source) and the hardware guarantees of the TEE. Likewise, data providers remain in control of their information, knowing it’s mathematically protected. The combination of on-chain DAO governance and off-chain TEE execution creates a feedback loop of trust: the blockchain ensures only approved code runs, and the TEE ensures the code runs correctly and privately on the data.

## Privacy & Verifiability

Delong’s core philosophy is “trust no one – verify everything.” The platform is designed so that participants do not need to place blind trust in any central entity or infrastructure. Instead, trust is established through code transparency, cryptography, and decentralized consensus. Below, we outline how Delong guarantees privacy and verifiability, turning traditionally trust-required processes into trustless ones:

- **Data Privacy by Design**: User-contributed data is always handled in encrypted form outside the enclave. From the moment of submission, data remains ciphertext until inside the secure TEE. This means that even if an attacker intercepted the data or a malicious insider tried to access stored files, they would only find gibberish. Within the enclave, the data is decrypted only for the duration of computation and cannot be extracted due to the TEE’s hardware-enforced isolation. No raw user data ever leaves the enclave, and no component of the system ever sees plaintext data except the algorithm running in the enclave (which itself has been vetted by the community). This zero-leakage architecture gives users confidence that sharing their sensitive information on Delong will not result in unwanted exposure.

- **Zero-Trust Execution**: The platform maintainers and node operators do not need to be trusted, because the system won’t allow them to improperly access or misuse data. Even the backend infrastructure is considered untrusted. The combination of on-chain approval and TEE enforcement means that a malicious operator cannot run arbitrary code to siphon data – the enclave will only execute signed, approved algorithms. Moreover, any attempt to tamper with the TEE’s code or environment would be detected via attestation. In essence, Delong eliminates the need for trust in the platform’s administrators. All parties – data providers, scientists, and observers – can independently verify that the system is doing only and exactly what it claims to do.

- **Verifiable Computing and Remote Attestation**: Every computation in Delong can be remotely verified to ensure it was executed correctly and under the agreed conditions. Remote attestation is a crucial mechanism here: the TEE generates cryptographic proof (a quote or report) of its identity and the exact code it’s running. This proof can be checked against the expected enclave measurement (a fingerprint of the approved code). Together with reproducible builds of the enclave software, it allows anyone to confirm that the binary running inside the TEE is compiled from the open-source code and has not been tampered with ￼. This guarantees the integrity and authenticity of the computation environment. In practical terms, before a user submits data, they could demand an attestation report from the TEE showing it’s running the Delong software version X (which is publicly auditable code) and not some malicious variant – only if the check passes will the user proceed, establishing a trustless handshake. Likewise, the blockchain can be configured to accept results only from attested enclaves, creating an end-to-end verifiable pipeline. The verifiability extends to algorithm execution results as well: since algorithms are deterministic (or managed for randomness), the community can theoretically re-run an approved algorithm on the same input in another trusted node to reproduce results, or use consensus from multiple TEE nodes to cross-verify outcomes.

- **Auditability and Transparency**: All relevant actions are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable audit trail. Every data contribution, algorithm submission, approval vote, and computation event can be traced. Community members and external auditors can review these logs to ensure compliance with protocols. Because the smart contract code for governance is open source, anyone can inspect the rules by which algorithms are approved or rejected. The platform’s logic being transparent means there are no hidden “black boxes” – a stark contrast to typical proprietary data analysis platforms. This transparency builds accountability: if any stakeholder tries to cheat (for instance, a scientist attempting to use an unapproved algorithm or a governance member colluding to approve insecure code), the evidence would be on-chain and could be acted upon by the DAO or community.

In summary, Delong’s model ensures:
- No Trust in Operators: Platform operators or infrastructure providers need not be trusted, as they have no ability to view plaintext data or alter computations arbitrarily (“trustless” infrastructure).
- No Exposure of Raw Data: Users’ raw data is never exposed to anyone except the enclave executing the analysis, preserving confidentiality at all times.
- Proof and Verifiability: The entire process is verifiable via open-source code and cryptographic attestation. Users and auditors can obtain proof that the system’s behavior corresponds exactly to the described protocol – a remote enclave will only run approved code, and that code is exactly what is published and audited ￼. This gives all stakeholders strong assurances grounded in math and code, rather than promises.

By combining these properties, Delong effectively removes the traditional trade-off between data utility and privacy. Researchers can extract insights from sensitive data as if they had full access, while data owners are protected as if they never shared the data at all. The motto is simple: don’t trust – verify. Every aspect of the platform from governance decisions to enclave computations can be independently verified, laying a foundation of privacy through technology and trust through transparency.

## Why TEE & Why Phala

### Choosing TEE for Secure Computation
Trusted Execution Environments were chosen as the backbone of Delong’s compute layer because they offer a powerful blend of security and performance for sensitive data processing. Alternative privacy-preserving computation techniques like multiparty computation (MPC) or fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can secure data but often at a steep cost in complexity or efficiency. In contrast, a TEE allows code to run in a shielded hardware enclave at near-native speed, utilizing the full power of modern CPUs or GPUs, which is crucial for heavy biomedical computations (such as genomic analysis or machine learning on health data). The TEE ensures that even the operating system or cloud provider hosting the enclave cannot peek into the data or alter the execution, effectively creating a black box of computation that only outputs what it’s intended to. This model provides what one might call “single-party MPC” – all data and code in one secure box, guarded by silicon. The result is unmatched security and confidentiality for computations, without requiring specialized cryptographic rewriting of algorithms. As noted by experts, TEEs enable sensitive computations to be securely isolated from the host environment, offering strong security, verifiability, and privacy guarantees ￼. In the context of Delong, using TEEs means we can run complex bioinformatics pipelines or AI models on raw data without ever exposing that data to the outside world – a capability that is game-changing for fields bound by data privacy laws.

### Why Phala Network
Delong is deployed on the Phala Network, a leading decentralized cloud compute network built around TEEs. Phala provides a robust, battle-tested infrastructure of thousands of TEE nodes (over 30,000 devices as of recent counts ￼), which is exactly the scale and security we need for a platform aiming to serve global research. There are several reasons Phala is an ideal foundation for Delong:

- **Decentralization and Scale**: Phala’s network of TEE workers is geographically distributed and permissionless, meaning no single entity controls the compute nodes. This aligns with Delong’s trustless philosophy – computations can be assigned to independent miners, increasing security (no central point of failure) and reliability (jobs can be replicated or load-balanced). The sheer number of workers in Phala means the platform can scale to support many simultaneous analyses and large datasets, with high availability.

- **Hybrid Blockchain-TEE Architecture**: Phala is designed as a Substrate-based blockchain with an off-chain TEE compute layer, mirroring the very architecture Delong needs. By building on Phala, we inherit a lot of critical infrastructure: on-chain mechanisms for registering and attesting worker TEEs, secure messaging between chain and enclaves, and built-in support for secret management. Phala’s Phat Contracts framework (TEE-based smart contracts) allows for developing secure off-chain computation logic that can easily interface with on-chain governance. Rather than reinventing the wheel, Delong leverages Phala’s years of development in bridging blockchain and TEEs, which has established trusted and verifiable computing solutions at scale ￼.

- **Security and Attestation**: Phala has a mature attestation system for its nodes. Every TEE worker in Phala attests its hardware and code to the blockchain, providing stakeholders confidence in the network’s integrity. For Delong, this means any compute node that processes bio-data can prove via Phala’s system that it’s running an unmodified, secure version of the Delong enclave code. This dramatically simplifies the trust setup – we can rely on Phala’s consensus and attestation as an additional layer of verification, on top of our own.

- **Community and Ecosystem**: As an open-source, community-driven network, Phala’s values resonate with Delong’s open-science mission. By deploying on Phala, Delong becomes part of a larger ecosystem of privacy-focused applications. This opens the door to collaborations (for instance, integrating zero-knowledge proofs or connecting with Polkadot’s interoperability features via Phala’s parachain status) that can further enhance the platform. Additionally, Phala’s native token economics (e.g., incentivizing node operators via the PHA token) ensure a sustainable supply of compute resources, which Delong can tap into without needing to create its own incentive layer from scratch.

In summary, the choice of TEE technology empowers Delong to achieve strong security and privacy guarantees in a performance-efficient way – a crucial factor for processing large biomedical datasets. And the decision to build on Phala Network provides Delong with a ready-made, reliable infrastructure that aligns perfectly with its needs for decentralized governance, attestation, and scalable confidential computing. This combination of TEE + Phala allows Delong to stand on the shoulders of proven technologies while focusing on the unique needs of longevity research.

## Open-Source Commitment

From its inception, Delong has been committed to openness and transparency. All components of the platform – from smart contracts to enclave code and client libraries – are released as open-source software. This open-source commitment serves several vital purposes:

- **Transparency and Trust**: By making the code publicly available, we allow anyone to inspect how Delong works. Researchers, security experts, and community members can review the implementation to verify that there are no hidden backdoors or vulnerabilities. This is especially important for a privacy platform – users shouldn’t have to take our word that their data is safe; they can examine the code themselves (or rely on audits by others in the community) to gain confidence. Open source code, coupled with the verifiability of TEE attestation, means that the claimed security and privacy protections can be independently confirmed, not just rhetorically but empirically.

- **Reproducibility and Scientific Rigor**: In the spirit of open science, Delong’s open source nature allows others to reproduce and build upon our work. Whether it’s verifying the results of an algorithm or deploying a similar system in another domain, the community can use Delong’s code as a reference implementation. This fosters a collaborative environment where improvements can be rapidly integrated. It also means longevity researchers can fully understand the tools they are using – the algorithms and processes aren’t a black box. This clarity is crucial when research findings might influence healthcare decisions; knowing that the underlying computation platform is open and peer-reviewed adds credibility to any discoveries made using it.

- **Community-Driven Development**: We believe that a distributed community of developers can accelerate innovation more than any closed team. By open-sourcing Delong, we invite contributors from around the world to help enhance the platform – be it optimizing performance, adding new features (such as support for additional data types or analytics methods), or improving security hardening. The field of privacy-preserving technology is rapidly evolving, and being open allows Delong to integrate the latest advancements (for example, incorporating new TEE hardware improvements or even complementary tech like zero-knowledge proofs for additional verification). Community governance can extend beyond just algorithm approval; it can also shape the roadmap of the platform itself.

- **Ethical Alignment**: Given that Delong deals with sensitive personal data and positions itself as a public-good platform for scientific research, it is ethically important that the platform operate with integrity and openness. Open-sourcing is a promise that we have nothing to hide in how data is handled. It shifts the paradigm from “trust us, we did it right” to “verify yourself, we have nothing to hide.” This openness also encourages adoption: universities, healthcare institutions, and citizen scientists are more likely to participate in or deploy an open system that can be vetted, as opposed to a proprietary closed solution.

All the code for Delong is available in our public repository, along with documentation to help others run or contribute to the project. We have also provided extensive technical papers and whitepapers detailing the security model (for those who want a deep dive into how we use TEEs, encryption, and blockchain). By keeping Delong open-source, we ensure that the platform’s data protection claims are testable and reproducible, not just marketing speak. We welcome feedback, issue reports, and contributions – the success of Delong as a trustless platform relies on the collective effort and scrutiny of the community.

## Vision

Our vision for Delong is to become a cornerstone of privacy-preserving scientific computing that will accelerate discoveries in longevity and beyond. We see a future where sensitive medical and biological data from around the world – genomic sequences, clinical trial data, real-world health records – can be pooled in a virtual commons without compromising individual privacy. In this future, researchers can run advanced algorithms (from AI-driven drug discovery to personalized medicine analyses) on a global dataset that was previously unimaginable, because Delong’s technology assures every data owner that their information remains confidential and secure.

While Delong’s current focus is on longevity research (an area in dire need of innovation), the underlying principles are applicable to any domain where data privacy and trust are paramount. Our long-term vision extends to supporting secure computations for biomedical research at large (e.g. cancer genomics, mental health data studies, infectious disease surveillance) and even outside of biomedicine in fields like finance or public governance analytics. We believe that by proving the model in the longevity space, we can demonstrate a template for “collaborative computation without compromise” across disciplines.

To realize this vision, we aim to continue refining both the technology and the community governance aspects of the platform. This includes exploring enhancements like federated learning within TEEs (so that algorithms can train on distributed data without centralizing it), integrating zero-knowledge proofs for result verification (adding an extra layer of assurance about outputs without revealing them), and expanding the network of TEE nodes (perhaps integrating multiple TEE hardware vendors or newer enclave technologies to reduce dependency on any single provider). On the community side, we aspire to foster a thriving DAO where longevity researchers, ethicists, data donors, and technologists all have a voice in how the platform evolves – from setting research priorities to defining ethical guidelines for algorithm approval.
